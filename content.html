          Who would have thought we'd come this far? I still remember seeing you
          at the Sport Center, eating your nails while waiting for the bus. You
          caught my attention, and I'm glad I decided to start up a
          conversation. You've turned out to be not only a pretty face & vibe,
          but also have a top tier personality, sweet like a candy cane. With a
          bonus of being a lover girl (I'm not sure about this though😂).
          <br />
          <span id="birthday-span">Happy 22nd birthday Sthembile🎂🥳🫵🏾</span>
          <br />
          Hopefully you enjoyed your big day❤️

          to take my place and sing for you😌
